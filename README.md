## 🛠️ Backend Setup (Python FastAPI)

### **Requirements**
- [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (required for some Python packages with native extensions)

- **Mac:**  
  ```sh
  brew install cmake
  ```
- **Linux:**  
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install cmake
  ```

### **Install Dependencies**
```sh
cd backend
python -m venv venv
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Run the Backend**
```sh
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
- The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

---

## ⚡ Recommended Python Packages

Your `requirements.txt` should include:
```
fastapi
uvicorn
pydantic
python-dotenv
# Add any other dependencies your backend uses
```

---

## 🧩 Environment Variables

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in both `client` and `backend` folders.
- Fill in your API keys, database URLs, etc.

---

## � Troubleshooting

- **Python errors?** Make sure you’re using Python 3.11+ and a fresh virtual environment.
- **Expo errors?** Delete `node_modules` and run `npm install` again.
- **Backend not connecting?** Check your `.env` and make sure the backend is running before starting the client.
- **CMake errors?** Make sure CMake is installed and available in your system PATH.
